# Imagify
> An image recognition machine learning project made using tensorflow.js

## Overview
Imagine being able to detect if a person was in a video, so you could then count how many people were present at a given time to estimate how busy an area was over the day ,or send yourself an alert when your dog was detected in a room of your house whilst you are away that maybe it should not be in. If you could do that you would be on your way to making your own version of Google nest Cam that could alert you when it sees an intruder(of any type) using your own custom hardware!
